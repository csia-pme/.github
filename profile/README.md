# Swiss AI Center

**The mission of the Swiss AI Center is to accelerate the adoption of artificial intelligence in the digital transition of Swiss SMEs. The associated socio-economic challenge is to increase their competitiveness, limit relocation and create new skills at the interface between laboratories and the practical use of artificial intelligence.**

SMEs in Switzerland account for 3 million jobs in 590,000 companies, or 60% of the working population. The digital transition is a major challenge for SMEs, impacting all areas, from administration and production to sales and purchasing. In this digital transition, many SMEs could increase their competitiveness and avoid relocation by accelerating the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in their digital portfolio. Indeed, players are predicting numerous use cases for AI in SMEs: marketing and sales targeting, greater efficiency in processing customer service-related documents, financial optimization, decision support, predictive maintenance - and in all fields, including retail, healthcare, energy and construction.

Currently, AI developments are extremely rapid and accompanied by a democratization of costs. Investments in AI are doubling every year, indicating strong activity in the creation of tools and services. Aware of these developments, the Federal Council has made AI a central theme of its "Digital Switzerland" strategy. Numerous AI projects are indeed under development, but mainly at the level of large companies and organizations. The adoption of AI by SMEs remains difficult. Various obstacles are cited, such as lack of knowledge, difficult access to local human skills and high investment. Two other key factors are also at play. The first is data security, with AI components essentially involving the use of cloud services, often outsourced outside Switzerland. The second relates to the sustainability of AI, which by its very nature needs to be frequently updated as contexts change.

The Swiss AI Center aims to set up a structure, develop tools and offer services that will enable SMEs to accelerate the adoption of AI components in their digital transition. On the one hand, the ambition is to bring together the AI skills of the 5 HES-SO engineering schools in French-speaking Switzerland with the creation of the first Swiss AI Center dedicated to SMEs. On the other hand, the aim is to offer SMEs access to a range of tools for faster adoption and deployment, such as tools for data preparation, rapid prototyping, quality control, bias detection and re-training. Finally, it will also open up services to support SMEs on the dimensions of knowledge acquisition, use case identification and AI accreditation readiness.

Thanks to this center bringing together its 5 engineering sites with access to over 80 researchers active in AI, the HES-SO will be identified as a leading partner in the field of AI for SMEs. The center will act as a catalyst for local expertise and offer services to accelerate the adoption of AI in areas of interest to SMEs. The project also aims to support the center beyond the program.
